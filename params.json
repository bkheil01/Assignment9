{"name":"Assignment9","tagline":"","body":"This page explains the steps I took to create my Dog Lover's Blog. \r\n\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst I created an MVC.net project in Visual Studio. Visual studio created everything that I would need to create this blog, including bootstrap. \r\n\r\nSecond I created a Blog Model that contained Name, About, multiple Past fields, Image, Favorite, Last, Date. This is for the blogger's Name, About the blogger's dog, multiple past fields for previously adopted dogs, an Image field for the owner's dog, favorite breed of dog, Last dog adopted, and the date of the last adoption.\r\n\r\nThird I created a view to set all of the fields above on the page in the order that I wanted them.\r\n\r\nFinally I create a controller called blogcontroller that will push all of the fields from the view to the model and vice versa. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nBrett Heil (@bkheil01)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
